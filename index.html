<h1>MY summer vacation</h1>

<h2>Atlanta</h2>

<p>This summer I went to <b>Atlanta</b>, Georgia for the summer so I could work to earn a little bit of money and spend some time with my family there. So the first day I went outside and watched the dogs and it was for like an hour. It was very hot then my grandma came outside and asked me if I wanted to help her paint the fence around the house, I said yes. So I helped her paint the fence we were out there for like 3 hours so we finished the fence then we went in and ate lunch I had a sandwhich with chips.
Then I went up stairs and watched a movie was fate of the furious. I honestly think that was the best fast and furious movie I have ever seen. Then later that week me and my uncle went outside to cut down and haul wood off for his fireplace. It literally took 5 hours. The logs were very heavy and I was struggling but I wanted money so I did it.</p>

<p>After I did that that very next week I had to wash my grandmas car I made that car squeaky clean. Then after that I got paid and then  I bought my school supplies.I bought some new black new balances.I got me some salt life shirts and got me some socks. Then the rest of my summer I went bike riding at mount paris. It was very fun we did the 7 mile trail.</p>
